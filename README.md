The app I created consists of a few questions about the history of South Africa. The app also gives you feedback on how you have done with the quiz. It has a ‘true’ and ‘false’ button for the user to pick an answer, and it also has a ‘next’ button for the user to skip to the next question. 

 

This is a screenshot of the Quiz app.
